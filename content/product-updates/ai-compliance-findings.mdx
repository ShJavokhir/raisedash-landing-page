## Manual Compliance Reviews Don't Scale

You open a driver's file. You check the medical card expiration. You verify the MVR is current. You look at the annual review date. You cross-reference against FMCSA requirements. Multiply that by every driver in your fleet, and compliance reviews eat hours you don't have.

And things still slip through.

## AI Findings in the Driver Compliance Panel

Raisedash now automatically analyzes driver compliance data and surfaces findings directly in each driver's compliance panel. When a new compliance snapshot is created (a document is uploaded, a certification is updated, a status changes), the system runs an analysis in the background and flags what needs attention.

You'll see findings appear in a dedicated section of the driver panel. Each finding explains what was detected, why it matters, and what action to take. No digging. No cross-referencing. The analysis comes to you.

## What Gets Flagged

The AI looks across the full compliance picture for each driver: document status, expiration timelines, regulatory requirements, and gaps between what's on file and what should be. Findings range from immediate issues (expired medical card, missing annual review) to upcoming risks (certifications expiring within 30 days).

## Background Processing, No Waiting

Analysis runs automatically when compliance data changes. You don't trigger it manually. You don't wait for a batch job. Results appear in the driver panel as they're ready, with status indicators showing when an analysis is in progress.

## Already Live

Open any driver's compliance panel and you'll see the AI Findings section. If there's nothing to flag, it'll tell you that too.

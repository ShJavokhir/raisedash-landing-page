## You Shouldn't Have to Check a Dashboard to Know What's Happening

A driver finishes a pre-trip inspection at 5 AM. You find out when you open Raisedash at 9. That's four hours of not knowing whether a defect was flagged or a vehicle was pulled from service.

Now you'll know in seconds.

## Telegram Notifications for Inspections

Raisedash can now push inspection alerts directly to your Telegram. When a driver completes a pre-trip or post-trip inspection, you get a message with the details that matter: who inspected, which vehicle, pass or fail, and any noted defects.

No app to install beyond Telegram. No extra login.

## Fleet-Specific Channels

This isn't a firehose of every inspection across every fleet. Notifications are scoped to specific fleets, so a safety manager overseeing West Coast trucks only sees West Coast inspections.

Set up separate Telegram channels for each fleet if you want. Or funnel everything into one. Your call.

## Why Telegram?

Drivers and fleet managers already live in messaging apps. Email is too slow for operational alerts. Telegram is free, works on every platform, and handles group channels well.

If you're the kind of safety manager who wants to know the moment something happens in your fleet, this is for you.

## Set It Up

Connect your Telegram channel in fleet settings. Once linked, inspection notifications start flowing automatically.

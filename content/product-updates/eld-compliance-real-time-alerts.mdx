## Stop Discovering Violations After the Fact

Every fleet manager knows the drill: You open your ELD dashboard Monday morning to find a driver who went over their 11-hour limit last Thursday. The violation is already on record. The damage is done.

**That ends today.**

Raisedash now monitors driver hours in real-time and sends proactive alerts before violations occur. When a driver approaches their HOS limits, both the driver and dispatch get notified immediately.

## What's New

- **Predictive Alerts**: Get notified 30, 15, and 5 minutes before a driver hits their limit
- **Dispatch Dashboard**: See all at-risk drivers in a single view, sorted by urgency
- **Driver App Notifications**: Drivers receive push notifications with clear instructions
- **Automatic Log Suggestions**: System recommends optimal break times based on route and schedule

## Why This Matters

FMCSA violations don't just cost money in fines. They impact your CSA scores, insurance rates, and shipper relationships. A single HOS violation can take months to roll off your record.

With predictive compliance alerts, you're not reacting to violations. You're preventing them.

## How It Works

1. Connect your ELD data to Raisedash (we integrate with all major ELD providers)
2. Set your alert preferences and notification channels
3. Raisedash continuously monitors driver status against FMCSA regulations
4. When a driver approaches a limit, alerts fire automatically

No manual monitoring required. No spreadsheet tracking. Just real-time compliance protection.

## Getting Started

This feature is available today for all Raisedash Shift customers at no additional cost. Log in to your dashboard to configure your alert preferences, or contact your account manager for a walkthrough.

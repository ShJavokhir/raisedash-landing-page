## Confusion Kills Applications

Driver applications aren't simple. Employment history going back 10 years. Accident records. License details across multiple states.

When drivers get stuck, they do one of two things: guess (which creates problems later) or abandon the application entirely.

## Chat Changes That

Now there's a chat bubble in the corner of the application. Drivers can ask questions and get answers in real-time from your team or ours.

"What counts as a recordable accident?"
"I drove for a company that went out of business—what do I put?"
"My CDL is from one state but I live in another now."

These questions get answered in minutes, not days.

## The Result

- **Fewer incomplete applications** — Questions don't become roadblocks
- **Better data quality** — Answers are correct the first time
- **Happier drivers** — They feel supported, not abandoned

Live chat is now available for all driver applications.

## Small Fleets Don't Have This Problem. You Do.

When you have 10 drivers, finding someone in a training list takes two seconds. When you have 80, it's a different story. Scrolling through an unsorted list of participants to check who completed what (or to invite a specific group) wastes time you don't have.

We fixed the participant experience.

## Filter, Sort, and Search

The training participants page now supports real filtering and sorting. Search by name. Filter by completion status. Sort by date, score, or progress. The data loads page by page instead of dumping everything at once.

For large fleets, this is night and day.

## Select All (or Just the Ones You Need)

Sending training invites to a batch of drivers? The invite dialog now has a "select all" toggle. Check everyone, then uncheck the few who don't need it. Or start from zero and pick individually.

Either way, it's faster than clicking 40 checkboxes one by one.

## Server-Side Performance

This isn't just a frontend filter slapped on top of existing data. Pagination, filtering, and sorting all happen on the server. That means the page loads fast regardless of how many participants you have.

## In Your Training Dashboard Now

Open any training program and you'll see the updated participant list. Filters are at the top. Pagination is at the bottom. Sorting works on column headers.

## Tables Aren't Great for Activity Feeds

The old audit log was a table. Columns for timestamp, user, action, and details. It worked, technically. But scanning through rows of near-identical data to find what actually happened? That's tedious.

We switched to cards.

## What Changed

Each audit event now gets its own card in a timeline layout. You can see who did what, when, and the context around it without your eyes glazing over a spreadsheet.

The information is the same. The format is built for humans who need to quickly scan activity and spot what matters.

## Why Audit Logs Matter in Trucking

DOT auditors want to see who accessed driver files, who made changes, and when. If your audit log is hard to read, you'll spend the audit scrambling to explain what happened instead of confidently showing the record.

Clean logs make clean audits.

## Already Live

Head to your audit log section. The new card layout is there now.

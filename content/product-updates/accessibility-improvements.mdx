## Built for Everyone

Not everyone uses a mouse. Some people rely on screen readers. Others navigate entirely by keyboard. And plenty of folks just want their browser to autofill forms correctly.

We've made improvements across the platform to support all of these.

## What Changed

**Screen reader support**
- Decorative icons are now hidden from screen readers (less noise)
- Icon-only buttons have proper labels ("Close", "Menu", etc.)
- Expandable sections announce their state

**Keyboard navigation**
- Focus indicators only appear when using keyboard (not mouse clicks)
- Tab order follows logical reading flow
- All interactive elements are reachable by keyboard

**Form improvements**
- Autofill now works properly on login and profile forms
- Input fields have correct autocomplete hints
- Placeholder text is more consistent

**Visual stability**
- Images have explicit dimensions to prevent layout shift
- Pages load without content jumping around

## Why This Matters

Accessibility isn't just about compliance—it's about not locking people out. A dispatcher with low vision should be able to use Raisedash. A safety manager who prefers keyboard shortcuts shouldn't be forced to grab a mouse.

These changes are live now across the entire platform.

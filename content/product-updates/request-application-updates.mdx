## The Old Problem

A driver submits their application. You review it. Something's missing—maybe an address is incomplete, or they skipped a previous employer.

Before, you had two options: reject the whole thing or call them up and manually fix it on your end. Neither was great.

## Now You Can Just Ask

Click "Request Update" on any submitted application. Write a quick note explaining what's needed. The driver gets notified via email or SMS and can go back in to make changes.

Their application status changes to "Pending Update" so you know it's in their court. Once they're done, it comes back for your review.

## What Makes This Better

- **No lost progress** — Drivers edit their existing application, not start fresh
- **Clear communication** — Your message tells them exactly what's needed
- **Audit trail** — Every request and response is logged for compliance

## FMCSA Compliance Note

This workflow helps you meet 49 CFR 391.21 requirements for complete driver qualification files. Missing fields get addressed before hire, not discovered during an audit.

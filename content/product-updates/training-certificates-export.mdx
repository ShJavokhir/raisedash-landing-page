## One Export, Everything You Need

When you export driver files, you want the complete picture. Employment applications, MVRs, medical cards, road test certificates—and now, training certificates.

## What Changed

The bulk driver export now includes a "Training Certificates" folder for each driver. Inside, you'll find PDFs of every training certificate they've earned through Raisedash Train.

The folder structure stays clean:
```
/Driver Name/
  /Documents/
  /Training_Certificates/
    - Hazmat_Safety_Certificate.pdf
    - Defensive_Driving_Certificate.pdf
```

## Perfect for Audits

DOT auditors sometimes ask for proof of training. Instead of switching between systems or digging through emails, just hand them the export. Training documentation is right there with everything else.

## No Extra Steps

If drivers have completed training through Raisedash Train, their certificates are automatically included. No boxes to check, no settings to change.

Available now on all driver exports.

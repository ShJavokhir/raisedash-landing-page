## The Old Way Had Too Many Clicks

You'd see a missing document on the compliance dashboard. Then you'd navigate to the driver's profile. Then find the right document section. Then upload. Then go back to compliance to check it off.

Four steps for something that should take one.

## Quick Actions on Compliance Items

Compliance requirements now have action buttons right where you see them. Missing a medical examiner's certificate? Click "Upload" on that line item and a dialog opens. Need a signature on an annual review? Click "Collect" and send the request. All without leaving the compliance view.

## What Actions Are Available

Depending on the document type, you'll see:

- **Upload** for documents you have on hand (certificates, licenses, test results)
- **Collect** for items that need driver input (signatures, acknowledgments)
- **Request** for documents the driver needs to provide

Each action opens a focused dialog. Do the thing, close it, and you're back on the compliance page with the status updated.

## Fewer Context Switches, Faster Resolution

Compliance work is already a grind. Jumping between pages for every document turns a 30-minute review into an hour. Quick actions keep you in flow.

## Live on Your Compliance Dashboard

Open any driver's compliance view and you'll see the action buttons next to each requirement.

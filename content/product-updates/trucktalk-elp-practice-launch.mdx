## Generic English Apps Don't Prepare Drivers for DOT Inspections

A DOT officer doesn't ask you to order coffee. They ask you to explain your ELD logs, describe your duty status, and identify shipping paper classifications. Duolingo doesn't cover that. Neither does Babbel. Neither does any general English learning app.

With 600+ drivers pulled off the road in California alone for failing ELP checks, and federal enforcement scaling across every state, drivers need practice in the English they'll actually be tested on.

We built TruckTalk to close that gap.

## What's Inside

TruckTalk is a free English Language Proficiency practice tool built entirely around trucking. Every word, phrase, and conversation is specific to what CDL drivers encounter on the road and during inspections.

**2,300+ trucking vocabulary terms** with definitions, pronunciation guides, example sentences, and native audio. Terms cover ELD logs, shipping papers, pre-trip inspection language, hazmat classifications, and dispatch communication.

**500+ example conversations** between drivers and DOT officers, dispatchers, shippers, and mechanics. Organized by topic: Survival Phrases, DOT Inspection English, Pre-Trip Vocabulary, Shipping Paper English, and HOS Talk. Every line has audio playback.

**2,900+ quiz questions** across six formats: multiple choice, image matching, fill-in-the-blank, listen-and-choose, read-and-answer, and term matching. All questions test real trucking knowledge, not abstract grammar.

**AI Voice Roleplay** is the standout feature. You open a scenario, and an AI-powered DOT officer starts talking to you. You respond out loud, in English, using your microphone. The AI scores your listening comprehension, response clarity, vocabulary range, and task completion. 50+ scenarios across three difficulty levels.

**Interactive document training** with replicas of ELD displays, Bills of Lading, and hazmat shipping papers. Tap any field to learn the English terminology in context.

## 11 Native Language Translations

Every definition, conversation line, and explanation can be translated on demand into Spanish, Punjabi, Hindi, Haitian Creole, Amharic, Somali, Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, French, and Uzbek. English stays visible alongside the translation so drivers build comprehension while studying.

## Free to Start

The free tier includes the complete Survival Phrases module, 3 AI voice roleplay sessions per day, 3 quizzes per day, and full dictionary access. No credit card. Premium starts at $9.99/month on the annual plan. Fleet plans available.

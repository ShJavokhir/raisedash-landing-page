## Driver Info Was Scattered Across Too Many Places

Documents in one section. Training status in another. Compliance gaps in a third. To get a complete picture of a single driver, you had to visit three or four different pages.

During a DOT audit, that's not just annoying. It's slow.

## One Profile, Every Tab You Need

Each driver now has a unified profile with tabs. Click a driver's name and you land on a single page with everything:

- **Documents** for DQF files, licenses, medical cards, and certificates
- **Compliance** for their current compliance status and gaps
- **Training** for course progress, quiz results, and completion history
- **Inspections** for pre-trip and post-trip records tied to this driver

Switch between tabs without losing your place. The URL updates with each tab, so you can bookmark or share a direct link to a driver's training history.

## Cleaner Actions

We also cleaned up how you take action on a driver's record. Instead of hover menus and scattered buttons, actions are organized by context. Document actions live in the documents tab. Training actions in the training tab. Everything where you'd expect it.

## Why This Was Overdue

A driver qualification file isn't one document. It's a collection of records that need to stay current and complete. Viewing them in disconnected pages worked against that reality.

Now the profile reflects how you actually think about a driver: as one person with one file.

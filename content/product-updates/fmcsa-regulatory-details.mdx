## Compliance Without the Guesswork

"What CFR section requires this?"
"How long do I need to keep this document?"
"Will an auditor check this?"

These questions used to mean opening the FMCSA website in another tab and digging through regulations. Not anymore.

## Regulatory Info, Right Where You Need It

Every compliance requirement in Raisedash now has an info button. Click it and you'll see:

- **CFR Citation** — The exact regulation (e.g., 49 CFR 391.51(b)(1))
- **Compliance Domain** — Whether it's DQF, Drug & Alcohol, Clearinghouse, etc.
- **Audit Classification** — How it's weighted in Part 385 Appendix B
- **Retention Period** — How long you're required to keep the document
- **Timing Requirements** — When something needs to be completed (pre-employment, annually, etc.)

## Why This Matters

During an audit, you need to speak the auditor's language. Knowing the exact CFR reference makes the difference between a smooth review and a scramble.

For safety managers, this means less time researching regulations and more time actually achieving compliance.

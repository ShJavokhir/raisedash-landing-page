## A Snapshot Isn't Enough

Knowing your compliance score today is useful. Knowing how it's changed over the past month is powerful.

Was that dip last week a data issue or a real problem? Is the new process working? Are things trending the right direction?

## Now You Can See the Trend

The compliance dashboard now shows your score history over time. A simple line chart that answers the question: "Are we getting better or worse?"

Each data point shows:
- Your overall compliance score
- The date
- Whether you were in good standing

## Spot Problems Early

A score that drops from 95 to 92 over a week might not trigger any alerts. But if you can see it on a chart, you can investigate before it becomes 85.

## Built for Safety Meetings

Pull up the chart during your weekly safety review. Show the team real progress. Hold yourself accountable with data, not hunches.

Score history is now live on the compliance dashboard.

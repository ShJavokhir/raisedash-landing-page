## Your Fleet Deserves a Home

Most carriers track vehicles in spreadsheets. Or worse, in someone's head. When an inspector asks "what trucks do you have?", the answer shouldn't require digging through insurance papers.

So we built fleet management into Raisedash.

## What You Can Do Now

Add your vehicles once and they're there for good. The fleet page shows every truck and trailer with the details that matter: VIN, make, model, year, license plate, and status.

But the real win is VIN decoding.

## Type a VIN, Get Everything Else

Enter a 17-character VIN and we hit the NHTSA database. Within seconds, you'll see:

- **Make and model** — Pulled directly from manufacturer records
- **Year** — No more guessing from the title
- **Body type** — Tractor, straight truck, trailer
- **GVWR** — Important for weight-based compliance

No manual entry. No typos. The federal database does the work.

## Why This Matters for Inspections

Your fleet list connects to pre-trip inspections. When a driver starts an inspection, they pick from your actual vehicles. The VIN is already there.

For safety managers, this means cleaner records. Each inspection ties to a specific vehicle with verified information.

## In the PTI Module Now

Find the fleet page under the Pre-Trip Inspections section in your sidebar. Add your first vehicle and see VIN decoding in action.

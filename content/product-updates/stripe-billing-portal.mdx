## Billing Shouldn't Require a Phone Call

Need to update your credit card? Download an invoice for accounting? Change your plan?

Before, you'd email support and wait. Now you handle it yourself.

## Self-Service Billing Portal

Click your profile icon, then "Billing." You'll land in a secure portal where you can:

- **Update payment methods** — Add a new card, remove an old one
- **View invoices** — Every charge, downloadable as PDF
- **Manage subscription** — See your current plan, make changes

The portal is powered by Stripe, so your payment info stays secure and never touches our servers.

## Why We Built This

Carriers shouldn't wait on us to fix a declined card. And we shouldn't be in the middle of routine billing tasks. Self-service is better for everyone.

## Where to Find It

Two places: the user dropdown menu (click your name in the top corner) or Settings > Billing. Either way, one click takes you there.

Available now for all paid accounts.

## Training Data Was Scattered

You had to click into each driver, then each training, then each module to figure out where someone stood. Multiplied across dozens of drivers and multiple training programs, it was a mess.

## One Dashboard to See It All

The new performance view gives you everything at a glance:

- **Completion stats** — Who's done, who's in progress, who hasn't started
- **Quiz scores** — How drivers performed on knowledge checks
- **Verification status** — Identity confirmation and video proctoring results
- **Time spent** — How long each module took

Switch between trainings using tabs. No more hunting.

## Aggregate Stats

Need the big picture? The dashboard opens with aggregate statistics across all your training programs. Total completions, average scores, and trends over time.

## For Safety Managers

This makes audit prep easier. When someone asks "are your drivers trained?", you can show them real numbers—not guesses.

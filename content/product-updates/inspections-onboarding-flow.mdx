## First Impressions Shouldn't Be Confusing

Opening a new product and landing on an empty dashboard with no guidance is a fast way to lose interest. You don't know what to configure first, how to invite drivers, or where your inspection data will show up.

## Guided First-Use Experience

The inspections product now includes a step-by-step onboarding flow for first-time users. When you open inspections for the first time, you'll see a guided setup that walks you through the essentials: connecting your fleet, configuring inspection templates, and inviting drivers to start submitting pre-trip and post-trip reports.

Each step is focused. Do one thing, move to the next. By the time you're through, your fleet is set up and ready to receive inspections.

## Skip If You Know What You're Doing

The onboarding is there for people who need it. If you've done this before or prefer to explore on your own, you can skip straight to the dashboard.

## 5 AM Compliance Checks Shouldn't Burn Your Retinas

Safety managers and dispatchers don't work banker's hours. You're checking driver files before sunrise and reviewing inspection reports after dark. A bright white screen at those hours is punishment.

So we built a dark theme.

## Warm, Not Harsh

This isn't the cold, blue-tinted dark mode you've seen in other apps. We went with warm tones that reduce eye strain without making everything look washed out.

Every component in the platform supports it: dashboards, tables, forms, modals, sidebars, charts. It's not a half-done skin. We touched every surface.

## How to Switch

Look for the theme toggle in your settings. Pick dark, light, or system (which follows your device preference). Your choice sticks across sessions and devices.

## Why This Matters Beyond Comfort

Accessibility isn't just about screen readers. It's about making software usable in real conditions. Trucking operations don't stop at 5 PM, and the tools shouldn't assume they do.

Dark theme is live now for all accounts.

## Passwords Are Out. One-Time Codes Are In.

Let's be honest: remembering another password is the last thing drivers need when they're juggling routes, inspections, and tight schedules.

So we removed passwords entirely from the training platform.

## What Changed

Logging into driver training now works like this:

1. Enter your email address
2. Check your inbox for a 6-digit code
3. Enter the code and you're in

That's it. No password to create. No password to forget. No frantic "reset password" requests at 6 AM when you're trying to finish a module before your shift.

## Why We Made This Change

The old email + password setup was causing friction. Drivers were getting locked out, support tickets were piling up, and people were spending more time on authentication than actual training.

One-time passcodes fix all of that. Your email *is* your verification—simple, secure, and one less thing to keep track of.

## The Bottom Line

Less time logging in. More time completing training and getting back on the road.

This update is live now across all driver training accounts.

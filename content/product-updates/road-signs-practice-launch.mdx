## When Did You Last Study Road Signs?

For most drivers, the answer is the day before their CDL written exam. Years ago. Maybe a decade ago. You passed, got your license, and never looked at a sign chart again.

Now DOT officers are holding up sign charts at roadside inspections and asking drivers to explain each one. In English. No translation apps. Fail, and you're placed out of service on the spot. The violation sits on your PSP for 3 years.

The MUTCD has over a thousand signs. We put all of them in one place.

## 1,094 Signs Across 6 Categories

**Regulatory (418)** covers speed limits, lane usage, turn restrictions, and everything with legal weight. **Warning (249)** covers curves, hazards, construction approaches, and school zones. **Construction (32)** is the orange work zone set. **Guide (254)** covers routes, distances, and services. **Hazmat (5)** covers placards and route restrictions. **Service (42)** covers gas, food, lodging, and hospitals.

Each sign includes a description, a "What to Do" section with the exact driver action, and context about why the sign exists.

## Study Your Way

**Flashcards** let you flip through signs at your own pace. Mark "Knew It" or "Didn't Know" after each card. A mastery system tracks every sign as New, Learning, Familiar, or Mastered. Filter by mastery level to drill your weak spots.

**Practice tests** include 600+ presets organized by category and difficulty. Or build your own with the Custom Test Builder: pick categories, set question count, choose difficulty, add a timer. A "Weak Areas" preset automatically targets signs you've gotten wrong most often.

**Six question types** go beyond basic multiple choice. Single choice, select all, true/false, image pick (match a description to the right sign), scenarios (real-world context), and sign assembly (multiple signs stacked on one pole).

## 10 Languages for Translations

On-demand translation supports Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, French, Russian, Portuguese, Turkish, Korean, and Uzbek. English stays visible alongside the translation. The goal is English comprehension, not bypass.

## Free for the Signs That Matter Most

Regulatory and Warning categories (667 signs) are completely free with a Google sign-in. Those are the two categories most likely to appear in a roadside assessment. Premium unlocks all 6 categories and starts at $8.97/month on the annual plan. Fleet plans available for enterprise.

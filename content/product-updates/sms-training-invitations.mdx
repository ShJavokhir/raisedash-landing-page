## Email Alone Wasn't Cutting It

Drivers aren't always checking their inbox. They're on the road, at a shipper, or grabbing a quick meal between loads. Training invites were getting buried—or worse, going to spam.

So we added SMS.

## How It Works

When you invite drivers to training, you'll now see an "Also send via SMS" toggle. Turn it on, enter their phone number, and they'll get a text message along with the email.

The text is short and to the point: a link to start their training. No app to download, no password to remember.

## Why This Matters

- **Higher reach** — Texts have a 98% open rate vs ~20% for email
- **Faster starts** — Drivers see the invite immediately
- **Less follow-up** — Fewer "I never got it" conversations

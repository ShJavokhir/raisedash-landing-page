## The Old Dashboard Was Cluttered

Too many cards. Too many numbers. You'd log in and spend the first minute figuring out where to look. The dashboard should answer one question fast: is my fleet compliant right now?

We rebuilt it from scratch.

## What's New

The first thing you see is a hero section with your top-level compliance metrics. Big, clear numbers. Green means you're good. Anything else tells you exactly where to focus.

Below that, the layout is tighter. Less visual noise. The sections you actually use are prominent. The ones you don't are out of the way.

## Built for the Morning Check-In

Most safety managers have a routine: log in, scan the dashboard, then dive into whatever needs attention. The new layout supports that workflow. Your eyes land on the important stuff first. No scrolling, no hunting.

## Same Data, Better Presentation

Nothing was removed. All the compliance data, driver statuses, and training metrics are still there. We just reorganized them so the signal comes through louder than the noise.

## Live Now

Log in and you'll see it. No toggle, no beta opt-in. The new dashboard is the dashboard.

## Proof That Stands on Its Own

When you share an inspection video—with insurance, during a dispute, or in an audit—context matters. Who recorded it? When? What vehicle?

Previously, that info lived in the app. Export the video and it was just a video file.

## Now the Info Travels With the Video

Every inspection video you download now has key details burned directly into the footage:

- **Driver name** — Who performed the inspection
- **Timestamp** — Exact date and time
- **Location** — Where the inspection happened
- **Vehicle info** — VIN or unit number

The watermark is subtle but legible. It doesn't obstruct the inspection footage, but it's there when someone needs to verify authenticity.

## Why This Matters

**For insurance claims:** Timestamped proof that the pre-trip was done before the incident.

**For disputes:** Evidence that can't be easily edited or questioned.

**For audits:** Documentation that answers "when" and "who" without additional paperwork.

## How It Works

Videos are processed automatically after upload. When the watermarked version is ready, it replaces the original in downloads. No extra steps required.

## Numbers Without Context Are Useless

A driver failed 12 quiz questions. Is that bad? Is that normal? Without a baseline, you're guessing.

Now you don't have to guess.

## Median Comparison Built In

The training performance page now calculates the median quiz failures across all completed trainings in your company. Each driver's results are shown alongside that number.

If someone fails 12 questions and your fleet median is 8, you'll see "+4 from avg" right there.

## Severity Indicators

We added visual cues so outliers jump off the screen:

- **Green** — Within 10 of the average. They're doing fine.
- **Yellow** — 10 to 19 above average. Worth a look.
- **Red** — 20+ above average. Needs attention.

A driver flagged red isn't necessarily a bad driver. Maybe they rushed. Maybe the training was their first exposure to the material. But you should know about it.

## Better Training Decisions

This helps you prioritize. Instead of reviewing every single training result, you can focus on the outliers. Offer additional coaching where it matters. Spot patterns before they become problems.

## Already Live

Check any participant's performance page to see the comparison. The severity indicator appears automatically once your fleet has enough completed trainings to calculate a meaningful median.

## Not Everyone Wants to Schedule a Call First

Some carriers know what they need. They've read the product pages. They've seen the features. They just want to sign up and start using it.

The old flow required a demo request. That meant waiting for a call, finding a time that works, sitting through a walkthrough you might not need, and then finally getting access. That's fine for enterprise buyers evaluating a six-figure contract. It's overkill for a 20-truck fleet that wants compliance software today.

## Self-Serve Signup Is Live

You can now create an account, select the products you need, enter payment through Stripe, and start using Raisedash immediately. No demo call required. No sales team in the middle.

The signup flow walks you through product selection step by step. You see what you're getting, what it costs, and you're in your dashboard within minutes.

## Billing Through Stripe

All billing runs through Stripe's customer portal. Update your payment method, change your plan, download invoices, and manage your subscription directly. No support tickets for billing changes.

## The Demo Option Is Still There

If you want a walkthrough before committing, you can still request a demo. This isn't replacing that path. It's adding one for people who'd rather just get started.

## Applications Used to End at "Approved"

A driver submits an application. You review it. You approve it. Then what? In the old flow, there was no way to mark that the driver was actually hired. The application just sat in "Approved" status forever, and the actual hiring decision lived in someone's head or a spreadsheet.

## "Hired" Status Is Now Part of the Lifecycle

Driver applications now support a "Hired" status. When you've made the hiring decision and the driver is officially on board, mark them as hired. The application moves to its final state, and your records reflect what actually happened.

It's a small addition, but it means the application lifecycle is complete inside the platform. No more ambiguity about which approved drivers actually joined the fleet.

## Already Live

Open any approved application and you'll see the option to mark it as hired.

## One Person Shouldn't Hold All the Keys

Most carriers start with one person managing compliance. Then the fleet grows. Now dispatch needs to see inspection records. The safety manager needs training reports. The owner wants audit logs.

Sharing login credentials is a terrible idea. We've seen it. We've fixed the messes.

## Email Invitations Are Live

Go to Settings, then Team. Click "Invite Member," enter their email, pick their role, and send.

They'll get an email with a link to join your organization. If they're new to Raisedash, they sign up first. If they already have an account, they can accept immediately.

## What the Invited Person Sees

A clear email explaining who invited them and to which company. One click to accept. No confusion about what they're joining or why.

Once they accept, they appear in your team list with the role you assigned.

## Pending Invitations

You can see every outstanding invitation. Resend if someone didn't get it. Cancel if you changed your mind. All from the same team settings page.

## Role-Based Access

Invitations include a role: Admin, Manager, or Member. Each role sees different parts of the platform. Admins manage the team. Managers handle compliance. Members view and report.

## The Bigger Picture

This is about getting compliance off one person's shoulders. Distribute the work. Keep the audit trail clean. Sleep better knowing the business doesn't depend on a single login.

# Pre-Trip Inspection Software: Modern DVIR Solutions for Fleet Management

## The Issue: Moving Away from Paper and Clunky Forms

For logistics companies, the Daily Vehicle Inspection Report (DVIR) represents the lifeline to safe fleet operations; however, technology has yet to catch up with this core operational process. Many truck fleet operators have identified the Daily Vehicle Inspection Report (DVIR) as the only thing the vehicle operator(s) can provide or use for their fleet safety—in essence making the DVIR the "Heart" of fleet safety. Consequently, many trucking fleets experience delays associated with the daily vehicle inspection report process whether it is due to a lost paper form or a poorly designed digital component that the drivers cannot properly enter data into and will lead to downtime or incomplete records.

To maintain your fleet road-ready as well as in compliance with the general safety standards set forth by your country's Department of Transportation (DOT) and also perform a proper pre-trip and post-trip vehicle inspection, you require the following type of tool that makes your life easier instead of more difficult.

Therefore, RaiseDash is the software application developed specifically for trucking fleets to modernize the daily vehicle inspection process for their North American fleets by providing the company with a cloud-based solution.

## 1. Mobile DVIR App: "Zero-Friction" Driver Experience

The most effective software does not require training or explaining how it works; therefore, we built the RaiseDash mobile App with this in mind with the end goal of creating an environment for drivers that allows for the least amount of resistance to performing the daily vehicle inspection, thereby eliminating the likelihood of drivers skipping or hurrying through the process.

With the removal of the most significant pain point for drivers who forget their password, drivers can now log in to our platform by either leveraging their existing Google account or by using one-click access through an Apple account, which allows them to log in from anywhere at any time.

Smart VIN Search allows drivers to search for their truck or trailer by entering only the last 4 digits of their VIN instead of typing out a long string of characters, allowing them to quickly find what they're looking for and start using the workflow.

## 2. Video-Based Fleet Inspections: Eliminating Pencil-Whipping

The introduction of video-based fleet inspections has particularly addressed the issue of pencil-whipping (ticking off boxes on the inspection sheet without actually looking at the part being inspected), which has caused significant problems for fleet managers and drivers alike. The majority of inspections conducted on the RaiseDash platform today are completed via a video; this provides true visual verification of each inspection carried out on a truck or trailer.

During a video inspection, drivers are required to use their phone cameras to film the walk-around of the vehicle. That way, there is clear physical verification that an inspection was conducted and visual proof for fleet managers to view.

Drivers are often better able to perform a walk-around video inspection documented on their phone instead of having to tap through one long list of components. In addition, video inspections will also provide visual proof for drivers to show to their supervisors in the event of a discrepancy.

## 3. Electronic DVIR Featuring Customization (Checklists)

Fleets that need specific data in their DVIRs have the ability to customize their DVIR according to the unique needs of their fleet. Rather than build a generic DVIR template, fleets have the ability to create a DVIR that is tailored to their specific maintenance needs.

**Photo Evidence:** A driver can take a photograph of an identified defect—such as a worn tire or engine warning light—and attach it directly to the data they are entering.

**Data-Rich Inputs:** Your inspection system can do more than tell you "Pass/Fail." It allows drivers to input specific values including tire pressure readings for each wheel, providing maintenance teams with granular data.

## 4. Integrated Fleet Maintenance Software (Slack and Telegram)

Most of today's dispatchers are using chat apps to dispatch their drivers in real-time. Your inspection software shouldn't interrupt that workflow.

RaiseDash is one of the few platforms that provides a deep integration with Telegram, Slack, and WhatsApp.

**Stay in Your Workflow:** Managers can receive and review inspection reports and update inspection results directly in the messaging apps they use to manage their drivers.

**Faster Response Times:** By integrating the inspection data into the communication hub for maintenance teams, it provides immediate response times to the issues reported by drivers.

## 5. The Fleet Manager Dashboard: Provides Comprehensive Insight into This Area

RaiseDash provides fleet managers with a complete overview of their operations while empowering their drivers via the application.

**Monitoring Frequency:** The item displays the exact time of when a driver has completed his or her pre-trip inspection and when they completed their post-trip inspection.

**Notifications via Automated Messaging:** The application will notify the driver directly, via the mobile device, when it’s time for both inspections to be performed and completed.

**Exported Reporting Capabilities:** Reports are produced by RaiseDash for use by fleets to evaluate their fleet's overall health as well as to create organized documentation for use by fleet safety personnel.

# Driver Onboarding Software for Trucking: Training Made Simple

If you own a trucking company, you know how hard it is to train new drivers. There is a lot of paperwork. Spreadsheets can get messy. Somewhere in the folders, certificates get lost. And when a DOT audit comes up, you have to go through your files to make sure everything is in order.

It doesn't have to be this way.

Meet Raisedash Shift, a platform for trucking companies to hire drivers that was made from scratch. This platform helps you train drivers, keep track of their progress, and stay compliant without all the trouble, whether you have 10 trucks or 500.

## The Real Problem with Training Drivers Today

To be honest, Most trucking companies are still training their drivers the old-fashioned way. Safety managers have to deal with emails, spreadsheets, and sticky notes all at once to figure out who has finished their training and who is behind. Someone else has to make a certificate by hand when someone finishes a course. Then put it away. Then, months later, they will remember where they put it.

Does this sound familiar?

And this is the thing. You have to train. FMCSA and DOT say that carriers must keep records of their safety training programs. During compliance reviews, inspectors want to see proof that your drivers got the right training. They want time stamps. They want more information. They want records that show exactly what was taught, when it was taught, and who finished it.

If you can't give this paperwork, you could face fines, higher insurance costs, and in very bad cases, threats to your right to operate.

## What Makes Raisedash Shift Unique

There are other places to get training. But most of them weren't made for trucking. They are general systems that try to work for all types of businesses. What happened? Drivers who are angry because they can't figure out how to finish a simple training module and call dispatch because the interfaces are confusing and they don't need the features.

Raisedash Shift was made just for trucking companies. Every feature, workflow, and piece of content was made to fit the way carriers really do business.

This is what makes it different.

### Made for Drivers Who Aren't Good with Technology

This is a big deal. Not every driver is good with technology. Many people have had trouble with training software that was hard to use in the past. The main goal of Raisedash Shift was to be simple.

Drivers get an email with a link in it. They click on the link. They can see their training. They finish it. No menus that are hard to understand. No downloading apps. You don't need to know anything technical.

Drivers can finish their training on a phone during a break without needing help because the interface is so easy to use. It's that easy.

### Works on Any Device, Anywhere

Drivers are out on the road, not at their desks. Raisedash Shift works great on computers, tablets, and phones. The mobile experience is smooth enough that it feels like a native app, but you don't need to download anything.

A driver can finish their training at any time that works for them, whether they are at a rest stop, waiting for a shipper, or home for the weekend.

### Automatic Certificates That Are Real

When a driver finishes a course and passes the quizzes, they automatically get a professional certificate. No work by hand is needed. No more running around to get signatures.

You can check these certificates. Auditors, insurers, and other people can check that the training was finished. Every certificate has information about when it was completed, and the platform keeps them safe so you can get to them whenever you need to.

### Documentation that is ready for an audit from day one

This is where Raisedash Shift really stands out. Every training session is automatically recorded with all the information. You can see exactly what each driver learned, when they learned it, how long they spent on each module, and how well they did on quizzes.

You don't have to go through old emails or file cabinets when DOT calls. Bring up the dashboard, make a report, and show them everything they need to see. It only takes a few seconds.

## A Huge Library of Pre-Made Courses

It takes a long time to make training materials from scratch. That's why Raisedash Shift has a huge library of ready-to-use courses that cover everything carriers need.

The course catalog has training on a lot of things, like Hours of Service rules, ELD compliance, drug and alcohol testing awareness, CSA scores, inspections before and after a trip, defensive driving, securing cargo, HazMat safety, and more.

There is also state-specific sexual harassment prevention training that meets the requirements in California, New York, Illinois, and other states that have laws about training.

You can also make your own training modules if you need something specific. Upload videos from your company, embed YouTube videos, write lessons in text, and make quizzes to see how much drivers know. The platform changes to fit your needs.

## Four Training Solutions for Different Fleet Needs

Not everyone can use Raisedash Shift. It gives you targeted solutions based on the needs of your fleet.

**Small Fleet Training** gives carriers with smaller budgets the same level of safety training that big companies get. You get the same full curriculum that big carriers use, but the prices are better for fleets with fewer than 50 trucks.

**Sexual Harassment Prevention Training** helps carriers follow the strict rules set by the state. The courses are for transportation companies and meet the requirements for training in several states.

One of the main reasons drivers leave their jobs is bad communication, which is what Driver and Dispatcher Training deals with. This program helps drivers and dispatchers work together better, which makes operations run more smoothly and keeps more drivers on the job.

**Entry-Level Driver Training** covers the theory that new CDL applicants need to know before they can take their skills test. It helps people who want to drive trucks pass their written tests and start their careers.

## Works with the tools you already have

Raisedash Shift is not a stand-alone thing. It works with ELD providers like Samsara and Motive, as well as TMS platforms and HR systems. There is full API and webhook support to connect with your existing workflows if you need custom integrations.

This keeps your data in sync between systems. No entering twice. No transfers by hand. Everything works well together.

### Get Started in Just One Day

One of the best things about Raisedash Shift is how quickly you can get started. Within 24 hours, most carriers are ready to go. You can start by making an account, adding your drivers, and giving them the training courses they need.

Drivers get emails with links that let them start training with just one click. No complicated process for getting started. No long setup calls. It's as easy as signing up and getting trained drivers.

And help is always available if you need it.

## Why Trucking Companies Are Switching to Raisedash Shift

Raisedash Shift is already being used by carriers all over the country to make their training programs easier. They are saving time, making it easier to follow the rules, and finally getting their driver paperwork under control.

The platform is the best option on the market right now because it is the easiest to use, the cheapest, and the most stable. People who work in trucking built it for people who work in trucking.

There is a better way if you are sick of messy spreadsheets, missing certificates, and being afraid of audits. Raisedash Shift puts everything together on a clean, modern platform that your team can actually use.

Your drivers should have access to training software that is easy to use. Give your safety managers tools that help them do their jobs better. And your business needs compliance documents that keep you safe when it matters most.

Raisedash Shift gives you all of that and more.
